# Simple Tabs Project

## Overview

The page consists of four tabs, with the first tab being active by default. When the user clicks on another tab, the content of the currently active tab is hidden, and the content of the selected tab is displayed.

It is part of one of the frontend projects from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/simple-tabs).

## Objectives

The purpose of this project was to revisit DOM manipulation and JavaScript without relying on frameworks, as I hadn't practiced it in a while. Despite being a simple project, it helped me rfresh some fundamental concepts of HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

## Features

- Four tabs with unique content.
- The first tab is active by default.
- Smooth transitions when switching between tabs.
- Basic DOM manipulation and event handling in pure JavaScript.
- Use of semantic HTML for better accessibility and structure.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the tabbed interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the layout and manages the transitions between tab contents.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the click events on the tabs, toggling visibility of the associated content.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Click on the tabs to switch between different content.
